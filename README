OVERVIEW

Sqloxx is a software library written in C++, using C++11 features. It
provides a high level wrapper around the SQLite database library, and
includes facilities for creating and classes of persistent objects, and
managing these persistent objects by means of an in-memory cache.

The library was developed by Matthew Harvey, originally for use in his own
projects, and is released in the hope that it will be useful to others.


DOCUMENTATION

HTML documentation for the library can be generated by running Doxygen (see
INSTALL file). Almost all of the Doxygen markup is contained in the C++
headers; so an alternative source of information on the Sqloxx API, is simply
to examine the headers directly.
