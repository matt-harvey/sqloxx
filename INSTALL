DEPENDENCIES

Sqloxx is written in standard C++, and utilizes some C++11 features. To build
and install the library, you will need:

	- A reasonably conformant C++ compiler and standard library implementation
	  (Sqloxx has been successfully built with GCC 4.7.2 and with later
	  versions; it has not been tested with other compilers)

	- CMake (version 2.6 or later)

	- The Jewel C++ libraries

	- The Boost C++ libraries (version 1.53.0 or later)

To build and run the test suite, you will need:
	
	- UnitTest++

	- A Tcl interpreter

To build the API documentation, you will need:

	- Doxygen

At the time of writing, these dependencies can be obtained from the following
locations:
	
	CMake: 		http://www.cmake.org
	Boost:		http://www.boost.org
	Jewel:      http://matthewharvey.net/projects/jewel
	UnitTest++:	http://unittest-cpp.sourceforge.net
	Tcl:        http://tcl.tk
	Doxygen:	http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen


STEP 1. INITIAL BUILD CONFIGURATION

Open a command line and "cd" to the project root.

On Unix-like systems, enter:

	cmake -i

(On Windows, you will need to use the -G option to choose a Makefile
generator, or else run "cmake-gui.exe .". See CMake documentation for further
details.)

You will be prompted with "Would you like to see the advanced options? [No]:".
Answer "n". Then follow the prompts.

If you run into trouble with the build or have atypical requirements, you can
return to this step and answer "y" to configure more detailed build options.


STEP 2. BUILD THE LIBRARY

At the project root, enter:

	make sqloxx


STEP 3. BUILD AND RUN THE TEST SUITE

This step is optional, but recommended. At the project root, enter:

	make test
	chmod +x test.tcl

To run the tests, on a Unix-like system, enter:

	./test.tcl

On Windows, enter:

	[tcl_intepreter] test.tcl

(Substitute for "[tcl_interpreter]" the command to invoke the Tcl interpreter
you have installed.)

The tests will then run (they may take several seconds). The result of the tests
will then be displayed to the console. If any tests fail, it would be
appreciated if you would send the developer your test output along with details
of your system and build environment. (See README for contact details.) If any
tests fail, you should not install or use the library.

On Windows, if the test does not run at all, or if it appears to run but
produces no output, it may be due to the interference of antivirus software,
which sometimes prevents just-compiled executables from being run. Pausing
the antivirus software, or else telling the software that the test
executable is trustworthy, is the only known solution to this issue.


STEP 4. TO INSTALL THE LIBRARY

At the project root, enter:
	
	make install

If on a Unix-like system, you may need to run this as root, i.e.:

	sudo make install

Assuming installation is successful, CMake will output the location of each
installed file.


STEP 5. TO BUILD THE API DOCUMENTATION

If you have Doxygen installed and want to generate API documentation, then
enter the following at the project root:

	doxygen

HTML documentation will then be generated in the project root directory,
under "html", and can be browsed by opening the following file in your
web browser:

	[project root]/html/index.html
