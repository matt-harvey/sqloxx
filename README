To run the tests, a Tcl interpreter is required.

On Windows, the tests can be run by executing runtests.bat. The
text of runtests.bat should be amended as required to call
the Tcl interpreter available on the system.

On Windows, if the test does not run at all, or if it appears to run but
produces no output, it may be due to the interference of antivirus software,
which sometimes prevents just-compiled executables from being run. Pausing
the antivirus software, or else telling the software that the test
executable is trustworthy, is the only known solution to this issue.

On Unix-based systems, the tests can be run by executing
test.tcl.
